# Code of Conduct

Our Pledge:

In the interest of promoting an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Standards:

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other unprofessional conduct

## Responsibilities:

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers may also ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement:

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at https://u.pe. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, both online and offline. Any violation of these rules is not taken lightly and may lead to permanent exclusion from the project space.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4.
